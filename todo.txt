hijack tab so when they hit it the long ideas thing comes up
automatically bring up long ideas after text reaches a certain length (that
might be annoying?)
make it receive sms ideas somehow
remove unused stuff from package.json etc
i could use bootstrap contextual classes as a "priority of this idea" or
whatever

are reactive tables a good idea? how do they look on mobile?

change "long" to "full"

reverse order of ideas (first ones should be on top)

width of the boxes should be minimum or stretch to the nearest input

get edit working

any way to get restufl "routes" with {id} type stuff in routes?

figure out why delete buttons aren't working

why arent' the hr's and the form lined up right?

look into having timestamps, sort by most recently created or edited...shouldnt
be hard
